TALENT DRAFT GAME
www.talentdraftgame.com

Globally there is dual pressure on leaders: Financial Gravity and Talent Gravity both of which press concurrently. If only one of these pressures existed, things would have been easier: In case of “Financial Gravity”, almost all HR offerings would be downgraded for everyone due to lack-of-affordability, or in case of pure “Talent Gravity”, all HR offerings would be pushed high up.
However, concurrent pressures require leaders to selectively and aggressively differentiate! In other words, serving the “average” employee (if anyone like that exists at all) does neither make sense nor function at all...
Once differentiating experiences, development, talent journey, reward, recognition etc. for critical talent is agreed upon, the task of identifying critical talent is kicked off.
Identifying critical talent looks straight-forward in theory but it ends up being very complicated.
It takes a lot of time, loses executive focus, triggers conceptual / impractical discussions on roles vs. individuals, initiates domain wars, triggers emotions, creates confusion around criticality vs. scarcity and in the end results in a list too long to differentiate!
Moreover, highly invested human capital data and analytics do not seem to help: “Performance Management” results in unreliable data about actual performance. “Potential Assessment” results in biased data about actual potential etc. In the end, still the dominating factor ends up being “judgment” in general, or art of line management specifically.
Even worse, HR functions ends up being perceived as incompetent at facilitating a high-impact decision for the organization!
Organizations need a practical approach to select individuals to differentiate! There is an increasing need to facilitate talent decisions around numbers and facts but not strictly tied to them.
This is where “Talent Draft Game” comes into the picture: Why don’t we put all leaders whom we expect to agree upon a list of talent to be differentiated in the shoes of the CEO and ask for their selections then? Talent Draft Game basically works based on idea of a fantasy-league draft and pushes leaders to recruit for the very same organization (which is searching for its talent to differentiate) from scratch!

Let’s provide leaders with a list of talents to select from together with only key data / demographics such as their functions, hierarchical (reporting) level, time in company, time in job, last performance scores, potential assessment etc.

Give them the task of critical talent selection on behalf of the CEO (or the top leader of the organization the game is being played for) in a serious format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGFylgTrdr0
Scenario: All individuals had been released from their roles and the organization. But we will bounce back! This is an opportunity. Your task is to rebuild the organization for increased success. Select X many individuals to start with.
Would the Legal Counsel still select Assistant Legal Counsel as the top critical talent? Would executives still discuss critical talent vs. critical role?
The basic set-up would include the following roles:

HR / Talent Expert as the Master Admin to define the Admin user(s)
HR / Talent Leader as the Admin user to set up the game
Executives who are expected to agree on critical talent as the Players
Management Team or Talents in general as the Pool
The game layout would have two fundamental alternatives, one of which is to be selected by the Admin at the set-up of the session):

Players run their “Talent Draft Game” on their own and in order of their individual choices of degree of differentiation, and provide basic explanations for their choices
Players run a snake order “Talent Draft Game”, concurrently and one by one, where each turn is time-limited and once someone from the Pool is selected by a Player, she is no longer available for other players – no explanations are needed
Additional layouts are possible, such as budget-constrained selections as in the case of fantasy-league drafts, but these can be added later.
From a Talent Management perspective, for the ideal output:

The leaders should have the traditional “Talent Draft Game” at first.
As the result of this first session, they are reported the results.
Later on, the very same group, or a more concentrated group of decision-makers, can gather up to first have a discussion on the results of the “Talent Draft Game” regular run and to play the snake-ordered concurrent “Talent Draft Game” in a competition manner, and see also those results.
Then the final list of critical talent can be compiled!
The game set-up to be completed by HR / Talent Leader or the Admin is as follows:

Session Name
Players: A selection of previously provided Players can be presented

Name and Surname
E-mail
o Talent Pool * Talent Pool Name * Simply an MS Excel file including the following at best (but only “Name and Surname” are required): * Personnel ID * Name and Surname * Time in Company * Function * Department * Role * Grade * Time in Job * Reporting Role * Hierarchical Level (N, N-1, N-2, N-3 etc.) * Span (Number of Direct Reports) * Last Performance Note * Previous Performance Note * Last Potential Assessment * Substitute for Role 1 * Substitute for Role 2 * Substitute for Role 3 * Upload will be controlled by the system to give a warning on: * Missing data fields for a simple control * Inconsistencies

o Roles Pool (Optional – provides additional critical role information if provided) * Roles Pool Name * Simply an MS Excel file including the following: * Role * Function * Department * Reporting Role * Hierarchical Level (N, N-1, N-2, N-3 etc.) * Upload will be controlled by the system to give a warning on: * The role with no “Reporting Role” should only be one and it should be the CEO / GM etc.

o Session Type (Self Run or Snake Draft) * For Self-Run, additional information required are as follows: * Session Start Date * Session Deadline * For Snake Draft, additional information required are as follows: * Draft Selection Order

Order Duration for each Player (i.e. 1 minute)

Number of Talents to be identified as the Core Team
The default choice would be %15 of the Pool
The number should be much larger for a Snake Draft as the Pool shrinks at every order
The experience of the game will be Menti-level easy. Most of the users, if not all of them, will be top executives, who will not be willing or able to pass through cumbersome processes or interfaces.

Client’s Master Admin is defined by our very own Jedi Admin
Admin users are defined by Client’s Master Admin
All other users are simply “Players” and they will be defined by the client’s Admin
Ideal login experience is “magic link” sent to the e-mail – or “passwordless sign-in with e-mail” in other words (www.excalidraw.com)
Once logged in, Player sees the instructions, separately crafted for Self-Run and Snake-Draft
Self-Run instructions are straightforward: You will select X many talents from the pool, in order of criticality for the success of the organization, and you will need to present basic explanations of rationale for each selection.
Why did you select this individual? (300 characters)
Which role do you have in your mind for this individual? (only if “Roles” are introduced by the Admin)
Drop-down list, which can be filtered based on Function, Department, Reporting Role, Hierarchical Level (N, N-1, N-2, N-3 etc.
“Other: Please specify” kind of an option may be needed
Signals the difference, if there is any, between the individual’s current role and the designated one
Snake Draft is easier but requires the individual to be familiar with the approach. Therefore, a sample run can be introduced for the players, such as selecting their favorite stars from the NBA’s all-time greatest stars (everyone would have an understanding of the stars then)
Players are introduced to the order and their time slot for each order
There is no need to give any specific reason or role for selections
For the self-run each order is converted to points in the following manner (Players do not need to know this – not even the Admin maybe):

For the individuals:
Selected individuals get “(Total Number of Talents Selected) + 1 - (Selection Order)” points
In other words: In a list 10 then Number 1 gets 10 points and Number 10 gets 1 point (criticality)

Individuals also get two other scores:

Number of times they were selected by a Player (popularity)
Their average order in cases when they were selected (demand strength)
In case of equal “criticality”, the individual who was selected by more players, the player with higher “popularity”, is presented above the other individual

If there is still equality, the individual who has a lower average order, higher “demand strength”, is presented above the other individual

For the roles
Same points calculations and ordering criteria apply for the roles as well
The output would be presented in an infographic manner and include:

Self-Run
Individuals
Order of Criticality – Most Critical Talents
Attributes of the most “critical” talents:
Functional distribution
Grade distribution
Average Time in Job
Hierarchical Level (N, N-1, N-2, N-3 etc.) distribution
Span distribution
Last Performance Note distribution
Last Potential Assessment distribution
For each talent, a separate card will be prepared:
Demographics
Criticality Score
Popularity Score
Demand Strength (How many times they were selected in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7…)
Roles they were selected for and the relevant frequency
A compiled report of individual rationale presented for their selection:
Simple List of individual explanations, as in the case of Booking.com reviews, with some degree of filter capacity (i.e. people who selected this individual at top 3 etc.)
AI-compiled report of the individual comments simple with a bright prompt which will take into account the selection order as well
Roles (if provided)
Order of Criticality – Most Critical Roles
Attributes of the most “critical” roles
Functional distribution
Hierarchical Level (N, N-1, N-2, N-3 etc.) distribution
For each role, a separate card will be prepared:

The output should also be presented in a presentation format, for later use in a talent discussion of the sample group!

Technology

Security will be the key as individual data is perceived as highly sensitive.
Integrations with the most popular Talent suites (such as SuccessFactors) can be explored
Subscription Model

Corporate Clients get their own Master Admins, with unlimited sessions and unlimited players throughout the year
Session bundles would be sold for others with decreasing price per session along with the increasing scale
One session would anyways require around 3-4 session openings: One for trial-and-error, another one for major errors and one as back-up
